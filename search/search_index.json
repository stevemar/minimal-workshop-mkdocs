Below is an example. Use https://bluedemos.com/show/2543 to provision instances of the Skytap environment as needed. Only IBMers can provision an instance, you'll need to log in with your w3ID. You're limited to one request at a time. You can schedule how long you want to keep the instance live. You'll be emailed a link and a password. Distribute these to the lab attendees. There's no cost to running these instances. Instances will automatically suspend after 2 hours of inactivity. Just turn them back on to continue. Enabling a non-default feature \u00b6 Sometimes images are provisioned that don't have everything enabled. Include any steps here for instructors to perform so students don't have to. Below is an example. Access the iis-server VM. Log in with the Linux credentials. Run the following command to change to the Information Server install path: cd /opt/IBM/InformationServer/Server/DSODB Edit the DSODBConfig.cfg file. set the DSODBON value to 1 . It should be the first value at the top of the file. Save your changes and exit your editor.
